# finance-manager
I want to further my skills in c++. 
After taking a OOP and intro to data structures/algorithms courses, I intend to challenge myself by making a personal finance manager program.

Some key software components I want to integrate:
    File I/O
    data structures (vectors, maps, etc...)
    OOP principles
    Works on an html page

Features:
    Track income and expenses
    Categorize transactions
    generate reports (monthly, weekly)

I will learn things along the way, dedicating at least 10 hours a week minimum to working on this program.

Ideas to create:
1. use classes and inheritance as a way to create individual account(classes) that will account for the inputs
    for example, one object will consist of a description, amount, etc... things that can be used to group or identify the inputs.

Where to start?
1. set up and study the correct way to create classes to handle inputs and overall function
2. make sure everything works smoothly when attempting to use the features
3. work on the html page to link the program with it

More ideas to come.


set up a pin initially to load up specific accounts

one base class with the inputs
child classes with operations that the program will be able to execute
 save accounts onto a seperate file for long term storage
