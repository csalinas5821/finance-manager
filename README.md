# finance-manager
I want to further my skills in c++. 
After taking a OOP and intro to data structures/algorithms courses, I intend to challenge myself by making a personal finance manager program.

Some key software components I want to integrate:
    File I/O
    data structures (vectors, maps, etc...)
    OOP principles
    Works on an html page

Features:
    Track income and expenses
    Categorize transactions
    generate reports (monthly, weekly)

I will learn things along the way, dedicating at least 10 hours a week minimum to working on this program.


7/1/24 
processes i want to work in order of when to complete them:
1. enter your monthly spendings into their categories (ask how much is spent per category (ex: needs, wants...))
2. display results
3. give suggestions on where to improve
4. save when done with each enter
5. generate reports
6. create webpage for it
7. upload bank statements for quick processing and no need to enter it all

how to get this to work/where to begin:
1. create a class that handles and stores all the entered information
2. create functions for each category and display the results
3. based on the spendings entered, give a suggestion to the user on where to improve
4. load information onto a file to save
5. reload stored information to generate and recall previous enters
6. finish odin-project and make a webpage for it
